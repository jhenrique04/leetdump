# leetdump
Yes, just another repository for dumping LeetCode problem solutions.

## Repository Structure
Solutions are organized by practice day, following this format:

```
├── id-problem-name
│   ├── rust/  # Solution in Rust
│   ├── python/  # Solution in Python
│   ├── README.md  # Link to the problem on LeetCode
```

Each problem folder includes implementations in Rust and Python;

Some problems may have multiple solutions in different variations.

The ```README.md``` inside each problem folder may contain explanations of the solution (if needed).

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute (somehow). Open a PR, fix a typo, or just stare at the code and wonder why it works.
